# Logistic-Regression-from-Scratch
Building a logistic regression from scratch

Below is a description of all the cells in the code

1. Imports all the necessary code needed to build the model
2. Define a sigmoid activation functioon
3. Test the sigmoid function
4. Define a function to initialize the weights and bias to zeros
5. Test the weight initialization function
6. Define a forward function to calculate the cost and weight,bias change factor using gradient descent equations
7. test the forward function defined above
8. Define a function to train the model given the number of epochs and learning rate of the algorithm#
9.Test the training function
10. defnine a function to classify item based on the trained weights from the algorithm above
11. put all the functions together to create a robust logistic regression model
12. after training you can plot the change in cost against the number of epochs to see how your model is training.
